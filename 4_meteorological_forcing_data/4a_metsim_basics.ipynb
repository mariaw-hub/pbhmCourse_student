    "data go into MetSim and how to set it up. To do so we will use the Reynolds \n",
    "Mountain East data that you've used previously. This data already has an hourly \n",
    "timestep with all of the forcing variables, which is sufficient to run SUMMA, \n",
    "so we're going to first aggregate just temperatures and precipitation to daily \n",
    "values and then use MetSim to estimate the required inputs for SUMMA and \n",
    "disaggregate back down to hourly timesteps. This gives us a handle on how the\n",
    "estimation routines compare to the originally observed forcings, and what kins\n",
    "of impacts they have on the simulation of the hydrologic cycle. We will \n",
    "specifically explore how these differences affect the snowpack in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let's get started! Below we've got some standard imports, notably we've\n",
